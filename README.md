# ClassInfoFetcher
Helper to get class infomation in order to choose better classes.

Simple usage, few requirements (only ddddocr is required if you need automatic captcha recognition)

Double major support

Based on Python3

To do:

Multipage support

This script is written in 2021 spring and helped me 3.5 years. It has multipage support before, but after a refactoring, I removed it.
It has a hard limit, using this method with request interval less than 3 seconds, elective site would deny your requests. This is a deliberate design.

Because "DO NOT USE AUTO ELECTOR FOR ELECTING, OR YOU SHALL RECEIVE SEVERE DISCIPLIARY PUNISHMENT BY THE SCHOOL", I DO NOT want to update this repo, so it will be archived even make private soon.
